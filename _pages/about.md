My name is Michelle de Groot, and I am a driven and ambitious researcher with a background in genetics and bioinformatics. Holding a Master’s degree in Bioinformatics and Biocomplexity from Utrecht University, I have developed a deep understanding of genetic analysis, data mining, and the application of bioinformatics tools. My academic journey also includes a Bachelor’s degree in Bioinformatics from HAN, Nijmegen, and a minor in Medical Biology from Radboud University.

Throughout my career, I have been committed to unraveling the mysteries of the human genome. My experiences in diagnostics, research and industry span several projects. At the Human Genetics Department of Radboud UMC Nijmegen, I implemented STR calling in a WES pipeline, enhancing genetic analysis with Java based framework. At UMC Utrecht’s Brain Center, I conducted a large-scale GWAS on ALS patients, confirming the association of the _UNC13A_ gene with survival.

Additionally, at the Center for Mathematical Sciences, MSD-Oss, I collaborated with international colleagues to enhance a viral detection pipeline. By securing the RVSD curation in a container and profiling the effects, I improved efficiency using Docker and conducted statistical analysis on the curation process. At the Psychiatry Department, Brain Center, UMC Utrecht, I analyzed genetic and epigenetic data to identify sex-specific biomarkers of aging in response to childhood stress, using PC-corrected epigenetic clocks for accurate biological age estimation.

In addition to my research expertise, I have applied my skills in the industry as a Junior Process Mining Consultant at Daticx. There, I work on identifying process bottlenecks and optimizing workflows through data and process mining, showcasing my ability to translate complex data into actionable insights.

Beyond my professional work, I am actively involved in extracurricular activities. From 2019 to 2023, I was a member of several committees in two different student korfball associations. Additionally, in 2023-2024, I served as the secretary on the board of the student korfball association in Utrecht, further developing my girl-boss capabilities.

My technical skill set includes proficiency in R, Python, Bash, Git, Java, SQL, and Docker, along with experience working on high-performance computing platforms. I am passionate about continuous learning and innovation, always seeking opportunities to apply my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities to cutting-edge medical research. I am eager to contribute to projects that push the boundaries of our understanding of genetics and improve healthcare outcomes.

In my free time, I enjoy participating in sports, particularly kickboxing and fitness, listening to live music at concerts or cafes or enjoy nature.

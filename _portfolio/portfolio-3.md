### Overview

Institution: Human Genetics Department, Radboud UMC Nijmegen <br>
Duration: 5 months (september 2020-februari 2021) <br>

### Summary

In this project at the Human Genetics Department of Radboud UMC Nijmegen, the primary objective was to enhance genetic analysis by implementing Short Tandem Repeat (STR) calling within the Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) diagnostic framework. The project involved several steps:

1.	Tool Assessment and Validation: Various STR calling tools were tested and evaluated to determine their accuracy and efficiency based on previously identified repeat expansions. This step ensured the selection of the most reliable tools for the integration.
2.	Integration in Diagnostic Framework: The best performing tool was integrated into the existing WES pipeline, creating an additional automated analyis of STR calling for all new patients. Additionally, re-analysis of almost 3000 patients with movement disorders resulted in 7 additional diagnoses. 
3.	Data Visualization: To improve the interpretation and usability of the STR data, mapping visualizations were added. These visualizations were designed to help geneticists get additional information about the STR calls that were made.

The successful implementation of STR calling added an extra type of variant calling within the WES pipeline, providing a more complete genetic screening for patients. This project helped me with technical proficiency in Java, bash, bioinformatics tools and working in an interdisciplinary team. It also emphasized the importance of thorough tool validation and effective data presentation in genetic research.
